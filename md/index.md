# Hosea, Amos and Zephaniah Study

<img src="img/hosea-and-gomer.jpg" width="350">

A 10 week study of the books of Hosea, Amos and Zephaniah.

Hosea helps us understand God's relationship to a rebellious people. Amos details the injustice of Israel and the nations and how God will respond with justice. Zephaniah lets us imagine God's judgement and know His steadfastness to His covenant with Abraham and His merciful love for his people.

So those are our themes for this study, **rebellion**, **justice**, and **God's steadfast love**. These books are written with rich emotion and imagery which will help us better understand God's character.
